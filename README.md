## Welcome to Origin Code Academy

This repository contains the resources you'll need while taking this course. 

Currently there's a **Projects** folder and a **Notes** folder. 

You'll find all the projects to be completed in the Projects folder. Each project will contain a readme file with the requirements for that project, and any materials that you'll need to complete it.

If you get stuck with a project outside of class or have any course related questions:

- Try to research the problem first. Take a break from coding and spend time researching your problem in the following places:
	- Documentation: Try to find the documentation for the technology you are using, such as the Angular docs for Angular and MSDN for C#/.NET.
	- StackOverflow: Try to find out if somebody has asked and answered your question here. 
	- Google: The shotgun approach - practice your Google-Fu. For errors, try pasting the exact error into Google. You'll usually find blog posts/stack overflow answers as a result.
- If you didn't find your answer this way, feel free to ask me or your fellow students for help!
- Email me [(sean@origincodeacademy.com](mailto:sean@origincodeacademy.com) or Cameron [(cameron@origincodeacademy.com)](mailto:cameron@origincodeacademy.com)

Let's do this!

Cheers,

##### Sean
